# API Integration Test Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The API integration test was failing because it was trying to insert data into Brainy and then search for it, but the data wasn't being properly embedded/vectorized or wasn't being found in the search results.

## Key Changes That Fixed the Issue

### Test Modifications
1. Removed the explicit `dimensions: 512` parameter from BrainyData initialization
   - This allows it to use the default dimensions that match the embedding model

2. Changed from using `addItem()` to using `add()` with `forceEmbed: true`
   - This ensures proper embedding of the text data

3. Increased the wait time for indexing from 500ms to 2000ms
   - Gives the HNSW index more time to update before searching

4. Added more detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### Embedding Functionality Improvements
1. Fixed how the Universal Sentence Encoder is loaded
   - Now ensures it uses the bundled model from the package

2. Improved type handling for TextDecoder to avoid potential compatibility issues

## Why It Works Now
The test is now passing because:
1. The data is being properly embedded through the `add()` method with forced embedding
2. The system has enough time to index the data before searching for it
3. The embedding model is being loaded correctly without dimension mismatches

These changes ensure that when data is inserted into Brainy, it's properly embedded and vectorized, and then can be successfully retrieved through semantic search without needing to run in Express or any other server environment.
