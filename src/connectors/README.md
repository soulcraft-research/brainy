### **3. Install and Configure**
```typescript
import { NotionConnector } from '@soulcraft/brainy-quantum-vault'
import { BrainyData } from '@soulcraft/brainy'

const brainy = new BrainyData()
await brainy.init()

const result = await notion.startSync()
console.log(`Synced ${result.synced} items from Notion!`)
```

## 🔧 **Open Source Interface**

This repository contains the **open source interfaces** that all Quantum Vault connectors implement:

- **`IConnector.ts`** - Base connector interface
- **`types.ts`** - Shared type definitions
- **`utils.ts`** - Common utility functions

These interfaces allow you to:
- ✅ **Build your own connectors** using the same patterns
- ✅ **Understand the API** before purchasing
- ✅ **Contribute improvements** to the interface design

## 🏗️ **Build Your Own Connector**

Want to create a connector for a service we don't support yet?

```typescript
import { IConnector, ConnectorConfig, SyncResult } from './interfaces/IConnector'

export class MyCustomConnector implements IConnector {
  readonly id = 'my-custom-connector'
  readonly name = 'My Custom Integration'
  readonly version = '1.0.0'
  readonly supportedTypes = ['documents', 'users']

  async initialize(config: ConnectorConfig): Promise<void> {
    // Your implementation here
  }

  async startSync(): Promise<SyncResult> {
    // Your sync logic here
  }

  // ... implement other required methods
}
```
