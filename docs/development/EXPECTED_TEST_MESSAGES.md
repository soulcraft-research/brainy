# Expected Messages During Vitest Execution

This document explains the various messages and errors that appear during test execution and why they are expected.

## Fixed Issues

### Duplicate Summary Output
- **Issue**: Previously, test summaries were appearing twice at the end of test runs
- **Fix**: Removed the verbose reporter from the configuration, keeping only the default and JSON reporters
- **Status**: Resolved

## Expected Error Messages

The following error messages appear during test runs and are expected as part of the test suite:

### S3 Storage Tests
- **Error**: `[MOCK S3] Error processing command: Error: NoSuchKey: The specified key does not exist.`
- **Source**: `tests/s3-storage.test.ts`
- **Explanation**: This error is expected and is part of the test for the S3 storage adapter. The test intentionally deletes a noun and then tries to retrieve it to verify it was properly deleted.

### Dimension Mismatch Errors
- **Error**: `Failed to add vector: Error: Vector dimension mismatch: expected 512, got X`
- **Source**: `tests/dimension-standardization.test.ts` and `tests/core.test.ts`
- **Explanation**: These tests specifically verify that the system correctly rejects vectors with incorrect dimensions. The error messages confirm that the validation is working as expected.

### API Integration Test Failure
- **Error**: `expected 500 to be 200 // Object.is equality`
- **Source**: `tests/api-integration.test.ts`
- **Explanation**: This appears to be an actual test failure that should be investigated separately. The test expects a 200 status code but is receiving a 500 error.

## Conclusion

Most of the error messages seen during test execution are expected and are part of testing error handling paths. These messages confirm that the system is correctly handling error conditions as designed.

The only unexpected issue is the API integration test failure, which should be investigated as a separate issue.
