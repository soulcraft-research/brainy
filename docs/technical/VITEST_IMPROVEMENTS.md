# Vitest Output Improvements

## Changes Made

The Vitest configuration has been updated to provide cleaner, more focused test output that shows only successes,
failures, and a nice summary report at the end. The following changes were implemented:

### 1. Reporter Configuration

- Removed the verbose reporter which was causing excessive output
- Configured the default reporter to:
    - Show a summary at the end
    - Display test titles for all tests
    - Use a compact output format

```javascript
reporters: [
  [
    'default',
    {
      summary: true,
      reportSummary: true,
      successfulTestOnly: false,
      outputFile: false
    }
  ]
]
```

### 2. Output Settings

- Set `hideSkippedTests: true` to reduce noise from skipped tests
- Set `printConsoleTrace: false` to only show stack traces for failed tests
- Added output formatting options:
  ```javascript
  outputDiffLines: 5;      // Limit diff output lines for cleaner error reports
  outputFileMaxLines: 40;  // Limit file output lines for cleaner error reports
  outputTruncateLength: 80; // Truncate long output lines
  ```

### 3. Console Output Filtering

Enhanced the `onConsoleLog` function to be more aggressive in filtering out unnecessary output:

- Added filtering for stdout logs to only show errors, failures, warnings, and test results
- Expanded the noise patterns list to filter out more common noise sources
- Added explicit handling to show logs that pass all filters

## Results

The test output is now much cleaner and more focused:

1. Only shows important information like test successes and failures
2. Displays stderr messages only when relevant (e.g., for error handling tests)
3. Provides a clean, readable summary at the end showing:
    - Number of test files passed
    - Number of tests passed
    - Duration information
    - Start time

## How to Run Tests

Use the standard npm test commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/core.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Recent Improvements (July 2025)

The Vitest configuration has been further enhanced to provide more detailed reporting and better console output suppression:

### 1. Multiple Reporters

Added multiple reporters to provide different levels of detail:

```javascript
reporters: [
  // Default reporter for basic progress and summary
  [
    'default',
    {
      summary: true,
      reportSummary: true,
      successfulTestOnly: false,
      outputFile: false
    }
  ],
  // Verbose reporter for detailed information about failures
  [
    'verbose',
    {
      onError: true,
      displayDiff: true,
      displayErrorStacktrace: true
    }
  ],
  // JSON reporter for machine-readable output
  [
    'json',
    {
      outputFile: './test-results.json'
    }
  ]
]
```

### 2. Enhanced Console Output Suppression

Improved the console output filtering to be more aggressive:

- Added a whitelist approach for stdout, only allowing specific test-related patterns
- Enhanced stderr filtering to only show actual errors
- Expanded the list of noise patterns to filter out common debug messages
- Added additional filtering for common debug output patterns

### 3. New Test Scripts

Added several new test scripts to provide different reporting options:

```bash
# Standard test run with default configuration
npm test

# Detailed report with verbose output
npm run test:report:detailed

# Generate JSON report for machine processing
npm run test:report:json

# Run tests in silent mode (minimal output)
npm run test:silent

# Show only progress and errors
npm run test:progress-only
```

## How to Use the New Features

### For Detailed Test Reports

When you need comprehensive information about test results, especially for failures:

```bash
npm run test:report:detailed
```

This will show detailed information about each test, including:
- Full test hierarchy
- Detailed error messages with stack traces
- Test durations
- Comprehensive summary

### For CI/CD Integration

When you need machine-readable output for integration with CI/CD systems:

```bash
npm run test:report:json
```

This generates a `test-results.json` file that can be processed by other tools.

### For Minimal Output

When you want to see only test progress without noise:

```bash
npm run test:progress-only
```

This shows only test progress indicators and critical errors.

### For Completely Silent Operation

When you want to run tests with minimal console output:

```bash
npm run test:silent
```

## Recent Improvements (July 2025)

### Pretty Test Reporter

A new visually appealing test summary reporter has been added to provide a clearer, more readable test summary. The pretty reporter:

- Uses colors and symbols to distinguish between passed, failed, and skipped tests
- Displays test results in a clean, tabular format
- Shows detailed statistics about the test run
- Clearly lists any failed tests with their error messages

To use the pretty reporter, run:

```bash
npm run test:report:pretty
```

For more details, see the [PRETTY_TEST_REPORTER.md](./PRETTY_TEST_REPORTER.md) document.

## Future Improvements

If further customization is needed, consider:

1. Creating custom HTML reports for better visualization
2. Integrating with notification systems for test failures
3. Adding performance benchmarking to the test reports

## Recent Fixes (July 2025)

### Fixed Duplicate Summary Output

The test output was showing duplicate summary information at the end of test runs. This has been fixed by:

1. Simplifying the reporters configuration to use only the necessary reporters
2. Removing the verbose reporter which was causing duplicate summary output
3. Keeping only the default reporter for console output and JSON reporter for machine-readable output
