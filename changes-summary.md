# Changes Summary

## Issue Description

The build process was failing with a TypeScript error:

```
(!) [plugin typescript] src/utils/embedding.ts (227:11): @rollup/plugin-typescript TS2741: Property 'init' is missing in type '{ embed: (sentences: string | string[]) => Promise<any>; dispose: () => Promise<void>; }' but required in type 'EmbeddingModel'.
```

The error occurred because the model object created when loading the Universal Sentence Encoder from local files was missing the required `init()` method defined in the `EmbeddingModel` interface.

## Changes Made

1. **Added the missing `init()` method to the model object in `src/utils/embedding.ts`**:
   - The model object created when loading from local files now includes an `init()` method
   - Since the model is already loaded at this point, the method is implemented as a no-op that logs a message
   - This ensures the object fully implements the `EmbeddingModel` interface

2. **Updated documentation in `SOLUTION.md`**:
   - Added a new section explaining the TypeScript interface compliance requirements
   - Documented the need for all three methods (`init()`, `embed()`, and `dispose()`) to be implemented

## Verification

The build process now completes successfully without TypeScript errors. The warnings about unresolved dependencies for 'url' and 'os' modules are expected and unrelated to our fix.

## Technical Details

The `EmbeddingModel` interface in `src/coreTypes.ts` requires three methods:
1. `init()`: For initializing the model
2. `embed()`: For converting text to embeddings
3. `dispose()`: For cleaning up resources

When loading the model from local files, we now ensure all three methods are implemented, maintaining type safety and consistent behavior across different loading methods.
