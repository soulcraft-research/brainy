HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search that is designed to be efficient and scalable. However, when dealing with datasets that can't fit entirely in memory (like terabytes of data), there are important considerations and adaptations needed.

## Standard HNSW Implementation Limitations

Looking at the implementation in this project, the standard HNSW approach has some memory limitations:

1. **In-Memory Index**: The core `HNSWIndex` class keeps all nodes and their connections in memory:
   ```typescript
   private nouns: Map<string, HNSWNoun> = new Map()
   ```

2. **Full Load During Initialization**: During initialization, all nodes are loaded from storage into memory:
   ```typescript
   // Load all nouns from storage
   const nouns: HNSWNoun[] = await this.storage!.getAllNouns()
   
   // Clear the index and add all nouns
   this.index.clear()
   for (const noun of nouns) {
     // Add to index
     this.index.addItem({
       id: noun.id,
       vector: noun.vector
     })
   }
   ```

## Approaches for Terabyte-Scale Data

For terabyte-scale data that can't fit in memory, several approaches can be used:

### 1. Disk-Based HNSW

Modified HNSW implementations can use disk-based storage with intelligent caching:

- **Partial Loading**: Only load the most frequently accessed parts of the graph into memory
- **Page-Based Access**: Organize the graph into pages that can be swapped in and out of memory
- **Memory-Mapped Files**: Use memory-mapped files to let the OS handle paging

### 2. Distributed HNSW

For truly massive datasets, a distributed approach is necessary:

- **Sharding**: Partition the vector space and distribute across multiple machines
- **Hierarchical Search**: Use a coarse quantization layer to route queries to the right shard
- **Federated Results**: Combine results from multiple shards

### 3. Hybrid Solutions

Practical implementations often combine multiple techniques:

- **Quantization**: Reduce vector precision (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit) to fit more vectors in memory
- **Product Quantization**: Compress vectors while maintaining search accuracy
- **Two-Tier Architecture**: Use a small in-memory index to route to larger disk-based indices

## Real-World Examples

Several systems implement HNSW for large-scale data:

- **Qdrant and Milvus**: Vector databases that support disk-based HNSW indices
- **FAISS**: Facebook's similarity search library with HNSW implementation that supports GPU and distributed setups
- **DiskANN**: Microsoft's disk-based approximate nearest neighbor search system

## Conclusion

While the basic HNSW algorithm requires the graph structure to be in memory for optimal performance, modified implementations can handle terabyte-scale data through:

1. Disk-based storage with efficient caching
2. Distributed architectures across multiple machines
3. Vector compression techniques
4. Hierarchical multi-tier approaches

These adaptations allow HNSW to scale to massive datasets while maintaining reasonable query performance, though typically with some trade-offs in terms of search accuracy or latency compared to a fully in-memory implementation.
