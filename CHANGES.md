### Fixed

- Fixed an issue in the web service where tests were failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'join')" error. The problem was a race condition in the FileSystemStorage constructor, where the path module was being used before it was fully loaded. The fix ensures that the path module is properly imported and initialized before creating the FileSystemStorage instance.
