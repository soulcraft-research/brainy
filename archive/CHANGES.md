## Recent Changes

### 2025-07-28

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue in FileSystemStorage constructor where path operations were performed before the path module was fully loaded. The fix defers path operations until the init() method is called, when the path module is guaranteed to be loaded.

#### Details

The issue was in the FileSystemStorage constructor where it was using the path module synchronously:

```typescript
constructor(rootDirectory: string) {
  super()
  this.rootDir = rootDirectory
  this.nounsDir = path.join(this.rootDir, NOUNS_DIR)  // Error here - path could be undefined
  this.verbsDir = path.join(this.rootDir, VERBS_DIR)
  this.metadataDir = path.join(this.rootDir, METADATA_DIR)
  this.indexDir = path.join(this.rootDir, INDEX_DIR)
}
```

However, the path module was being loaded asynchronously via dynamic imports:

```typescript
try {
  // Using dynamic imports to avoid issues in browser environments
  const fsPromise = import('fs')
  const pathPromise = import('path')

  Promise.all([fsPromise, pathPromise]).then(([fsModule, pathModule]) => {
    fs = fsModule
    path = pathModule.default
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error('Failed to load Node.js modules:', error)
  })
} catch (error) {
  console.error(
    'FileSystemStorage: Failed to load Node.js modules. This adapter is not supported in this environment.',
    error
  )
}
```

The fix:
1. Modified the constructor to only store the rootDirectory and defer path operations
2. Updated the init() method to initialize directory paths when the path module is guaranteed to be loaded

This ensures that path operations are only performed when the path module is available, preventing the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'join')" error.

## Statistics Optimizations Implementation

### Overview

This section summarizes the changes made to implement statistics optimizations across all storage adapters in the Brainy project. The optimizations were originally implemented for the s3CompatibleStorage adapter and have now been extended to all storage adapters.

### Changes Made

#### 1. BaseStorageAdapter Enhancements

The BaseStorageAdapter class was refactored to include shared optimizations:

- Added in-memory caching of statistics data
- Implemented batched updates with adaptive flush timing
- Added error handling and retry mechanisms
- Updated core statistics methods to use the new caching and batching approach

Specific changes:
- Added properties for caching and batch update management
- Implemented `scheduleBatchUpdate()` and `flushStatistics()` methods
- Updated `saveStatistics()`, `getStatistics()`, `incrementStatistic()`, `decrementStatistic()`, and `updateHnswIndexSize()` methods

#### 2. Storage Adapter Updates

##### FileSystemStorage

- Implemented time-based partitioning for statistics files
- Added fallback mechanisms to check multiple storage locations
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy statistics files

##### MemoryStorage

- Updated to be compatible with the BaseStorageAdapter changes
- Leverages the in-memory nature of this adapter for efficient caching

##### OPFSStorage (Origin Private File System)

- Implemented time-based partitioning for statistics files
- Added fallback mechanisms to check multiple storage locations
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy statistics files

#### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated statistics.md to reflect that optimizations are implemented across all storage adapters
- Added a new section describing the implementation across different adapter types

### Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**: Reduced storage operations through caching and batching
2. **Better Scalability**: Time-based partitioning helps avoid rate limits and reduces contention
3. **Historical Data**: Daily statistics files provide a historical record of database usage
4. **Consistent Experience**: All storage adapters now provide the same optimizations
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy statistics files are still supported

### Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure they don't break existing functionality. The specific statistics test requires additional setup (dotenv package and AWS credentials) but general tests are passing.

### Conclusion

The statistics optimizations originally implemented for the s3CompatibleStorage adapter have been successfully extended to all storage adapters in the Brainy project. This ensures consistent performance and scalability across different storage backends.
