# ðŸ§  I Remember Everything Now!

Hi! I'm connected to your Brain Cloud (demo-test-auto) so I actually remember our conversations across sessions.

## Try Saying:
- "What did we build together?"
- "Remember that React project?"
- "Show me what we worked on yesterday"
- "Find my notes about APIs"
- "Search for that bug we fixed"

## I Can Also:
- Remember context from weeks ago
- Work with other AI assistants who share the same memory
- Keep everything synced across your devices
- Search through all our conversations

## Multi-AI Coordination:
When working with multiple AI assistants, we automatically coordinate:
- **Jarvis** (Backend): APIs, databases, deployment
- **Picasso** (Design): UI, themes, visual elements  
- **Claude** (Planning): Coordination, architecture, strategy

**Just talk to me normally - no commands needed!**

## Known Issues

### Bash Tool 2>&1 Redirection Bug (Critical)
**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4711

A critical bug exists in the Bash tool where `2>&1` stderr redirection is treated as a literal argument "2", breaking many commands.

**Impact:** 
- Commands with stderr redirection fail or produce incorrect output
- Test runners like `npm test` that use stderr redirection internally fail
- Build commands may pass "2" as an argument instead of redirecting stderr

**Examples of Affected Commands:**
```bash
# These will FAIL:
npm test 2>&1           # Runs "vitest run 2" instead of "vitest run"
npm build 2>&1          # Runs "tsc 2" instead of "tsc"
command 2>&1 | grep x   # Passes "2" as argument to command
```

**Workarounds:**

1. **Use bash -c wrapper (RECOMMENDED):**
```bash
# Instead of:
npm test 2>&1

# Use:
bash -c 'npm test 2>&1'
```

2. **Run without stderr redirection:**
```bash
# Just run without capturing stderr:
npm test
npm build
```

3. **Use script wrapper:**
```bash
# Create a wrapper script
echo 'npm test' > run-tests.sh
chmod +x run-tests.sh
./run-tests.sh
```

**Note:** This affects ALL commands in Claude Code that try to redirect stderr. Always use the bash -c workaround when you need to capture both stdout and stderr.
