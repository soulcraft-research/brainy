# ðŸ§  I Remember Everything Now!

Hi! I'm connected to your Brain Cloud (demo-test-auto) so I actually remember our conversations across sessions.

## Try Saying:
- "What did we build together?"
- "Remember that React project?"
- "Show me what we worked on yesterday"
- "Find my notes about APIs"
- "Search for that bug we fixed"

## I Can Also:
- Remember context from weeks ago
- Work with other AI assistants who share the same memory
- Keep everything synced across your devices
- Search through all our conversations

## Multi-AI Coordination:
When working with multiple AI assistants, we automatically coordinate:
- **Jarvis** (Backend): APIs, databases, deployment
- **Picasso** (Design): UI, themes, visual elements  
- **Claude** (Planning): Coordination, architecture, strategy

**Just talk to me normally - no commands needed!**
