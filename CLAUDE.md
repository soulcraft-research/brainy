# ðŸ§  I Remember Everything Now!

Hi! I'm connected to your Brain Cloud (demo-test-auto) so I actually remember our conversations across sessions.

## Try Saying:
- "What did we build together?"
- "Remember that React project?"
- "Show me what we worked on yesterday"
- "Find my notes about APIs"
- "Search for that bug we fixed"

## I Can Also:
- Remember context from weeks ago
- Work with other AI assistants who share the same memory
- Keep everything synced across your devices
- Search through all our conversations

## Multi-AI Coordination:
When working with multiple AI assistants, we automatically coordinate:
- **Jarvis** (Backend): APIs, databases, deployment
- **Picasso** (Design): UI, themes, visual elements  
- **Claude** (Planning): Coordination, architecture, strategy

**Just talk to me normally - no commands needed!**

## Known Issues

### Bash Tool 2>&1 Redirection Bug
A known bug exists in the Bash tool where the `2>&1` stderr redirection operator is sometimes treated as a literal argument, leading to the addition of a "2" in command output.

**Explanation:** When `2>&1` is used with pipes, particularly in direct commands, the system misinterprets it as a separate argument instead of a redirection instruction. This results in the literal "2" being included in the command's output.

**Reproduction Example:** A command like `echo "test" 2>&1 | cat` might incorrectly output "test 2" instead of the expected "test".

**Workaround:** Encapsulating the command within a bash -c wrapper can circumvent this issue. For instance, `bash -c 'echo "test" 2>&1 | cat'` correctly redirects stderr and produces the expected output.

**Note:** This issue primarily affects direct commands and is not typically observed when executing scripts or commands wrapped with bash -c.
